The album also has some softer moments, such as "The Bleeding", a ballad that deals with a broken relationship and the pain of letting go. The song has a haunting melody, emotional vocals and a powerful chorus that will tug at your heartstrings. Another standout track is "Death Before Dishonor", a patriotic anthem that pays tribute to the soldiers who fight for their country. The song has a catchy riff, a sing-along chorus and a message of loyalty and honor.
 
The album closes with "Meet the Monster", a dark and menacing song that showcases the band's heavier side. The song has a sinister riff, a growling vocal delivery and a chorus that warns "You don't want to meet the monster in me". The song is a fitting end to an album that is full of energy, emotion and aggression.

Powtoon is a popular online platform for creating animated videos and presentations. But what if you want to use Powtoon offline, without an internet connection? One possible solution is to download your Powtoon project as an EPUB file, which is a format for digital books. EPUB files can be opened by various applications on Windows 10, such as Calibre or Sumatra PDF[^1^]. Here are the steps to use Powtoon offline with EPUB files:
 
1. Create your Powtoon project online and save it.
2. Go to "My Powtoons" and click on the "Download" button next to your project.
3. Select "EPUB" as the file format and click on "Download".
4. Wait for the download to finish and locate the EPUB file on your computer.
5. Open the EPUB file with your preferred application and enjoy your Powtoon offline.

Note that some features of Powtoon may not work properly in the EPUB format, such as interactivity, transitions, or sound effects. To get the full Powtoon experience, you need to use it online or download it as a video file[^2^].

Powtoon is a versatile tool that can help you create engaging and informative videos and presentations for various purposes. You can use Powtoon to make explainer videos, marketing videos, educational videos, social media videos, and more. Powtoon offers a wide range of templates, characters, backgrounds, icons, and animations that you can customize to suit your needs. You can also add your own voiceover, music, images, and text to your Powtoon project.
 
One of the benefits of using Powtoon online is that you can access your projects from any device and collaborate with others in real-time. You can also share your Powtoon online with a link or embed it on your website or blog. Powtoon also integrates with various platforms and tools, such as Google Drive, YouTube, Facebook, PowerPoint, and more. You can export your Powtoon to these platforms with a few clicks.
 
However, if you want to use Powtoon offline, you have some options as well. As mentioned above, you can download your Powtoon as an EPUB file and open it with an EPUB reader. This can be useful if you want to read your Powtoon like a book or print it out. Alternatively, you can download your Powtoon as a video file (MP4) and play it with any media player. This can be useful if you want to watch your Powtoon on a large screen or burn it to a DVD. To download your Powtoon as a video file, you need to upgrade to a premium plan.

Powtoon has a variety of plans to suit different needs and budgets. The free plan allows you to create up to three Powtoon projects with a maximum length of three minutes each. The free plan also has some limitations on the features and quality of the Powtoon. The premium plans range from $19 to $99 per month and offer more features, such as unlimited projects, longer duration, higher resolution, more templates, and more export options. You can also get a discount if you pay annually or choose a team or education plan.
 
If you want to edit your Powtoon offline, you need to download it as a PowerPoint file (PPT). This option is only available for premium users. To download your Powtoon as a PowerPoint file, go to "My Powtoons" and click on the "Download" button next to your project. Select "PowerPoint" as the file format and click on "Download". Wait for the download to finish and locate the PowerPoint file on your computer. Open the PowerPoint file and edit it as you wish. Note that some animations and transitions may not work properly in PowerPoint.

Pithru Tharpanam is a Hindu ritual that is performed to offer homage and gratitude to one's ancestors. It is believed that by doing this, one can receive their blessings and remove any obstacles or sins caused by them. Pithru Tharpanam is usually done on Amavasya (new moon) days, especially during the Pitru Paksha (fortnight of ancestors) in the month of Bhadrapada (September-October).

In such cases, one can perform Pithru Tharpanam at home with simple materials and procedures.

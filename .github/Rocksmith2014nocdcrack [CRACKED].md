# How to Play Rocksmith 2014 Without a CD
 
Rocksmith 2014 is a popular music video game that allows you to learn and play guitar using a real instrument. However, some players may find it inconvenient or expensive to buy and use the official Rocksmith Real Tone Cable, which is required to connect your guitar to your PC or console.
 
Fortunately, there is a way to play Rocksmith 2014 without a CD or a cable, using a simple software tool called Rocksmith2014NoCDCrack. This tool bypasses the game's DRM protection and allows you to use any audio input device as your guitar input. You can also play the game offline without needing to insert the CD every time.

# Longcat H3D Binaural Spatializer: A 3D Audio Plugin for Immersive Headphone Mixing
 
Have you ever wanted to create 3D audio mixes for headphones, but found it too complicated or tedious? If so, you might be interested in Longcat H3D Binaural Spatializer, a plugin that lets you visually place and animate sounds in a full-3D interface.
 
Longcat H3D Binaural Spatializer is a 3D audio binaural plugin for Digital Audio Workstations. It works with major audio software (such as Cubase, Pro Tools 9 & 10, Logic, Live, Pyramix, Nuendo or REAPER), and allows you to create immersive 3D mixes for headphones, by visually animating a large number of audio tracks in a full-3D interface[^1^] [^2^].

Some of the features of Longcat H3D Binaural Spatializer are:
 
- **3D object-based mixing:** use the 3D interface to visually place and animate sounds.
- **Longcat Audio H3D technology:** when listening on headphones, H3D allows panning sound in 3D all around the listener's head.
- **Unique HRTF processing:** H3D uses Longcat own processed HRTF filters in order to achieve the best spatialization effects.
- **H3D Presence:** independently adjust H3D's immersion effect using the Presence parameter.
- **Automation:** fully automate parameters and 3D animation of audio tracks.
- **No tedious settings:** Just insert H3D plugins and start moving sounds in 3D.

Engineering drawing is a graphical language that engineers use to communicate their ideas and designs. It involves creating and interpreting drawings of objects and systems, using standard symbols, conventions, and techniques. Engineering drawing can be done manually or with the help of computer-aided design (CAD) software.

Orthographic projection is a method of representing a three-dimensional object in two dimensions. It involves projecting the object onto a series of planes that are perpendicular to each other, such as the front, top, and side views. Orthographic projection preserves the true shape and size of the object, but does not show its depth or perspective.

Engineering drawing and orthographic projection are important skills for first year engineering students, as they help them to visualize and analyze problems, design solutions, and communicate their work. The books by nd bhatt and ac parkinson are useful resources for learning these skills, as they provide clear explanations, examples, and exercises. They also cover other topics related to engineering drawing, such as dimensioning, sectioning, isometric projection, and auxiliary views.
  
One of the challenges of engineering drawing and orthographic projection is to avoid ambiguity and confusion in the drawings. To achieve this, engineers follow certain rules and standards, such as the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) and the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). These standards specify how to draw and label different elements of the drawings, such as lines, angles, dimensions, tolerances, and symbols.
  
Another challenge of engineering drawing and orthographic projection is to represent complex and curved objects in a simple and accurate way. To do this, engineers use various techniques, such as hidden lines, dashed lines, center lines, and cutting planes. These techniques help to show the features of the object that are not visible in the main views, such as holes, slots, fillets, and chamfers.
  
Engineering drawing and orthographic projection are essential skills for first year engineering students, as they form the basis of many other engineering disciplines and applications. By mastering these skills, students can improve their spatial reasoning, creativity, and communication abilities. The books by nd bhatt and ac parkinson are valuable guides for learning these skills, as they cover both the theory and practice of engineering drawing and orthographic projection.

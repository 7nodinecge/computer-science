El Gran Combo de Puerto Rico was founded in 1962 by Rafael Ithier, a pianist and former member of Cortijo y su Combo. Ithier wanted to create a new band that would continue the legacy of Cortijo, who was one of the pioneers of salsa music in Puerto Rico. He recruited some of his former colleagues from Cortijo's band, such as Eddie PÃ©rez, HÃ©ctor Santos, MartÃ­n QuiÃ±ones, and Roberto Roena, as well as some new talents, such as PellÃ­n RodrÃ­guez and Andy MontaÃ±ez.
 
The band debuted with their first album, AcÃ¡ngana, which was an instant success and established them as one of the leading salsa bands in Puerto Rico and Latin America. They followed with more albums and hits, such as El MenÃº, Ojos Chinos, Un Verano en Nueva York, BrujerÃ­a, Arroz con Habichuela, and many more. They also toured extensively around the world, performing in countries such as Colombia, Venezuela, Panama, Mexico, Peru, Ecuador, Spain, France, Italy, Japan, and the United States.

- Choose your mode wisely. The game offers two modes: EXTRA and ADVANCED. EXTRA mode is based on the older KOF games, where you can charge your power gauge manually and use evasive rolls and super jumps. ADVANCED mode is based on KOF '96, where you can stock up to three power gauges and use dashes and hops. Each mode has its own advantages and disadvantages, so experiment with both and see which one suits your playstyle better.
- Learn your characters' moves. The game has 35 characters, each with their own unique moves and combos. You can check the moves list in the pause menu or in the practice mode. Try to memorize the inputs and timings of your characters' moves, especially their special moves and desperation moves. You can also watch some gameplay videos online to see how other players use your characters effectively.
- Use your team wisely. The game allows you to choose three characters for your team, and you can switch between them after each round. You can also choose their order before each match. Try to balance your team with different types of characters, such as rushdown, zoning, grappler, etc. You can also use the affinity system to get extra power gauges if your characters have good relationships with each other. You can check the affinity chart in the gallery mode.
- Practice your combos. The game has a combo system that allows you to chain different types of attacks together for more damage. You can practice your combos in the practice mode or in the training mode. You can also use the combo counter to see how many hits you can do. Try to learn some basic combos for each character, as well as some advanced combos that require power gauges or specific conditions.
- Use your power gauges wisely. The game has a power gauge system that allows you to use special moves and desperation moves. In EXTRA mode, you can charge your power gauge manually by holding A + B buttons, or automatically when you are low on health. In ADVANCED mode, you can stock up to three power gauges by attacking or getting hit. You can use one power gauge to enter MAX mode, which enhances your attacks and allows you to cancel some moves into others. You can also use one or more power gauges to unleash desperation moves, which are powerful attacks that can turn the tide of the battle.

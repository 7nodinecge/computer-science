The film begins with a song that introduces the members of the joint family headed by Ramkishen (Alok Nath), a wealthy businessman. He lives with his wife Mamta (Reema Lagoo), his three sons Vivek (Mohnish Bahl), Prem (Salman Khan) and Vinod (Saif Ali Khan), his daughter Sangeeta (Neelam), his daughter-in-law Sadhana (Tabu), who is Vivek's wife, and his grandchildren. The family is happy and harmonious, except for Mamta's brother Anand (Mahesh Thakur), who is jealous of Ramkishen's success and tries to create rifts between the brothers.
 
The film follows the events that lead to the family's separation and reunion. The first major conflict arises when Ramkishen decides to divide his business among his sons, giving the largest share to Vivek, who is his eldest son and also adopted. Mamta feels that this is unfair to Prem and Vinod, who are her biological sons, and starts to favor them over Vivek. She also becomes suspicious of Sadhana's loyalty to Vivek and accuses her of having an affair with Prem. This causes a misunderstanding between Vivek and Prem, who are very close to each other.
 
The second major conflict occurs when Prem falls in love with Preeti (Sonali Bendre), who is Anand's daughter. Anand does not approve of their relationship and tries to sabotage it by spreading false rumors about Preeti's character. He also plots to kill Vivek by hiring a goon named Rakesh (Rajeev Verma). However, his plan backfires when Rakesh shoots Anand instead of Vivek. Anand survives but is paralyzed and confesses his crimes to Ramkishen. Ramkishen forgives him and accepts Prem and Preeti's marriage.

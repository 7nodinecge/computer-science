Well, there are many reasons why train sim games can be enjoyable and educational for players of all ages and backgrounds.
  
One of the benefits of train simulation games is that they can provide real-life experiences that are otherwise inaccessible or impractical for most people.

Another benefit of train simulation games is that they can offer immediate feedback and knowledge retention. By playing train sim games, you can test your skills and knowledge in a safe and controlled environment, without risking any real consequences. You can also receive feedback from the game or other players on how well you are performing and what you can improve. This way, you can learn from your mistakes and successes, and retain the information better than reading a book or watching a video.

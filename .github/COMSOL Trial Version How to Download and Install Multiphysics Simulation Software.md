COMSOL MultiphysicsÂ® is a general-purpose simulation software based on advanced numerical methods. It allows you to create physics-based models and simulation applications for a wide range of engineering disciplines and phenomena. You can also use add-on modules to specialize in specific areas such as electromagnetics, structural mechanics, acoustics, fluid flow, heat transfer, and chemical engineering. With COMSOL MultiphysicsÂ®, you can also build and deploy your own simulation apps using the Application Builder and COMSOL Compilerâ¢ or COMSOL Serverâ¢.
 
To get a free trial of COMSOL MultiphysicsÂ®, you need to have a COMSOL Access account and an on-subscription COMSOL license attached to it or a software trial provided by your sales representative. If you do not have a COMSOL Access account, you can create one for free on the COMSOL website. Once you have an account, you can log in and go to the product download page[^1^]. There, you can select the version of COMSOL MultiphysicsÂ® that you want to download and install on your computer. The latest version as of March 14, 2023 is 6.1.0.346.
 
After downloading and installing the software, you can start using it for your simulation projects. You can also access various resources to help you learn how to use the software, such as tutorials, examples, webinars, training courses, and documentation[^2^]. You can also contact your sales representative or technical support team if you have any questions or issues during your trial period.

What is Multiphysics Simulation?
 
Multiphysics simulation is the process of modeling and simulating physical phenomena that involve multiple interacting physics domains. For example, you can use multiphysics simulation to study how heat transfer affects the structural deformation of a metal part, how fluid flow influences the acoustic vibrations of a pipe, or how electric fields affect the chemical reactions in a battery. Multiphysics simulation can help you understand, predict, innovate, and optimize your designs and processes.
 
Why Use COMSOL MultiphysicsÂ® Software?
 
COMSOL MultiphysicsÂ® software is a powerful and user-friendly tool for multiphysics simulation. It offers several advantages over other simulation software, such as:
 
- It has a flexible and intuitive user interface that allows you to combine multiple physics in any order and create custom physics models.
- It has a comprehensive library of predefined physics interfaces and material properties that cover a wide range of engineering applications.
- It has a robust and efficient solver that can handle complex and nonlinear problems with high accuracy and speed.
- It has a built-in Application Builder that lets you create simulation apps that can be run by anyone, anywhere, without requiring a COMSOL license.
- It has a seamless integration with CAD and other third-party software through LiveLinkâ¢ products.

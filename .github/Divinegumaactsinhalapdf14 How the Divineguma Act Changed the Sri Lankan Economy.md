The Divineguma Act is important for Sri Lanka because it intends to mobilize people into a national development process at community level, thus building up regional, district and national level co-ordinating network and developing and promoting a micro-finance banking system. The Act also seeks to improve the individual, family, group and community centered livelihood development activities, in furtherance of the economic development process and in giving effect to the national policy of alleviating poverty and ensuring social equity[^3^].

The Divineguma Act has been controversial since its inception, as it was challenged in the Supreme Court by several petitioners who argued that it violated the Constitution and encroached on the powers of the provincial councils. The Supreme Court held that some provisions of the Act required the approval of the people at a referendum and also required a two-thirds majority in Parliament. The Act was amended accordingly and passed by Parliament with a two-thirds majority on January 8, 2013[^4^].

The Divineguma Act provides for the establishment of a Department of Divineguma Development, which is headed by a Director-General appointed by the President. The Department is responsible for implementing the policies and programmes relating to Divineguma development, including the promotion of livelihood development, social security, community empowerment, micro-finance and banking services, and rural infrastructure development. The Department is also authorized to issue guidelines, regulations and circulars for the effective administration of the Act.

The Divineguma Act also provides for the establishment of Divineguma community based organizations at rural level, which are voluntary associations of persons who are engaged in Divineguma development activities. These organizations are registered with the Department and are eligible to receive financial and technical assistance from the Department. The Act also establishes a co-ordinating network at the district level and national level, consisting of representatives from various stakeholders, such as government officials, Divineguma community based organizations, Divineguma community based banks and banking societies, non-governmental organizations and civil society organizations. The co-ordinating network is responsible for planning, monitoring and evaluating the Divineguma development activities at their respective levels.

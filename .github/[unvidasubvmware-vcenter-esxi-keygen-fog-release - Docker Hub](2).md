## Tips and Tricks for Alien vs Predator 3 Multiplayer
 
Now that you know how to download and play Alien vs Predator 3 multiplayer for free, you might want to learn some tips and tricks to improve your skills and have more fun. Here are some useful advice for each faction:
 
### Alien
 
- Stay with the pack. You are more likely to survive and kill if you cooperate with other aliens and attack as a group.
- Use your speed, mobility, and wall-tail attack. You can surprise your enemies by attacking from above, behind, or any angle. Your tail is your most powerful weapon, so use it wisely.
- Avoid direct confrontation. You are vulnerable to long-range weapons and blocking predators. Try to sneak up on your prey and use your stun and insta-kill abilities.
- Knock out the lights. You can make yourself harder to spot by destroying any light sources nearby. Use your focus to see in the dark.
- Counter-attack predators. If a predator engages you in melee, don't panic. Learn to time your blocks and counter-attacks, and avoid pouncing or light attacking a blocking predator.

### Predator

- Use your cloak and vision modes. You can become invisible to marines and aliens by activating your cloak, but be careful of sound and movement detection. You can also switch between different vision modes to track your enemies better.
- Use your plasmacaster and smart disc. These are your best long-range weapons, as they can deal massive damage and track your targets. Aim for headshots or direct hits for maximum effect.
- Use your combi stick and wrist blades. These are your best melee weapons, as they can block and counter alien attacks and deal heavy damage. You can also throw your combi stick for a quick kill.
- Use your mines and traps. You can set up mines and traps around the map to ambush your enemies or protect yourself. You can also use them to lure enemies into a trap by making noise or shooting them.
- Use your trophy kills. You can perform trophy kills on stunned or unaware enemies by pressing E. This will give you more points and health, but also make you vulnerable for a few seconds.

### Marine

- Stick together. You are stronger as a team than as a lone wolf. Stay close to your allies and cover each other's backs.
- Use your flashlight and motion tracker. You can use your flashlight to see in the dark and spot cloaked predators or hidden aliens. You can also use your motion tracker to detect enemy movement around you.
- Use your pulse rifle and shotgun. These are your best weapons, as they can deal high damage and have good accuracy and rate of fire. The pulse rifle also has a grenade launcher that can be useful against groups of enemies.
- Use your flamethrower and smart gun. These are your special weapons, as they can deal massive damage and have unique effects. The flamethrower can set enemies on fire and destroy alien eggs. The smart gun can auto-aim at enemies and shoot them down.
- Use your grenades and turrets. You can use grenades to damage or stun enemies or clear out an area. You can also use turrets to defend a position or provide fire support.

We hope these tips and tricks will help you become a better player in Alien vs Predator 3 multiplayer. Remember to practice, experiment, and have fun!
